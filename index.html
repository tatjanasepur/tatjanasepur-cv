<p>

      Hello,<br><br>

      I am Tatjana Šepur, a master's student of mechanical engineering currently working as an intern, where I develop applications for tracking employee attendance and assist with internal systems.  

      Although my background is technical, my interests and work are increasingly focused on IT, programming, and software solutions.  

      I’ve worked on practical mini-projects, maintained university websites, and created tools for small businesses – all of which helped me realize that IT is my true direction.  

      I am proactive, eager to learn, and I thrive when solving problems and creating something useful.  

      I am ready for a new chapter in a serious company and confident that I can bring energy, ideas, and dedication to your team.<br><br>

      Looking forward to the opportunity,<br>
<strong>Tatjana</strong>
